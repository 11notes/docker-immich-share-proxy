**Expose your Immich shares publicly without exposing Immich itself, all on the same domain!**

# SYNOPSIS
**What can I do with this?** This image will make it possible to securely expose your Immich shared albums without giving any access to Immich itself. It acts as a proxy between your reverse proxy and Immich to only expose what is needed to share. It works on the same domain name, there is no need to configure an alternative name just for sharing. You can check the Traefik example on how to use Immich and the share proxy on the same domain.

**This is cool and all, but how does it work?**
First, setup your external domain in your Immich instance to the same domain you will be using on Traefik to expose Immich internally and externally.

![Immich External Domain](https://github.com/11notes/docker-immich-share-proxy/blob/main/img/immich.external.domain.png?raw=true)

After that, simply create a share in Immich. You can use passwords too, but you can‚Äôt prevent downloading, this option is ignored. You will get a sharable link.

![Immich Sharing Link](https://github.com/11notes/docker-immich-share-proxy/blob/main/img/immich.share.link.png?raw=true)

That‚Äôs it. If you send someone this link, and you have setup your Traefik or Nginx for the /share prefix, the person receiving the share can now access all pictures from the share, without having any access to Immich itself. You can of course add additional authentication via Authentik middleware or whatever you prefer or simply use the password feature of Immich itself.

For the download all option you need to also add an API key from Immich. Go to your account settings:

![Immich Account Settings](https://github.com/11notes/docker-immich-share-proxy/blob/main/img/immich.apikey.png?raw=true)

and create a new API key for Immich Share Proxy

![Immich API key](https://github.com/11notes/docker-immich-share-proxy/blob/main/img/immich.apikey.proxy.png?raw=true)

and copy the key
